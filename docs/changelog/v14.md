# V14.0.0 - The Cognitive Revolution

> **Release Date**: 2026-01-15
> **Codename**: "Silent Sentinel" & "System 2"

Boring V14.0.0 marks the transition from an "AI Coding Tool" to a **Cognitive Autonomous Agent**. It introduces the **4-Layer Cognitive Architecture**, enabling the agent to "Think before it Acts" using System 2 reasoning. Alongside this, we introduce the **One Dragon Flow** for end-to-end development, a complete **Notification System v2**, and a dedicated **VSCode Extension**.

## 🌟 Major Features

### 🧠 Cognitive Architecture (System 2)
- **Sequential Thinking**: The agent now uses a structured thinking process (`sequentialthinking`) to analyze problems, revise assumptions, and plan strategies before writing a single line of code.
- **Semantic Tool Router**: A new context-aware router (`tool_router.py`) that filters 60+ tools based on the current **Flow Stage** (Design, Implement, Polish), reducing token usage by 80%.

### 🐉 One Dragon Flow
- **End-to-End Autonomy**: A unified flow that takes a single user intent and autonomously traverses the entire SDLC:
    1.  **Design**: Architecture planning & Impact prediction.
    2.  **Implement**: Code generation & test writing.
    3.  **Polish**: Security scanning & Code review.
    4.  **Verify**: Automated testing & validation.
- **Command**: `boring flow "Your intent here"`

### 🔔 Notification System 2.0
- **Unified Manager**: Centralized `NotificationManager` supporting multiple channels simultaneously.
- **Channels**:
    - **Desktop**: Native OS toast notifications with sound.
    - **Slack/Discord**: Webhook integration for team updates.
    - **Email**: Critical alerts via SMTP.
- **UI**: New "Glassmorphism" design for Web Dashboard and Toast notifications.

### 💻 Developer Experience (DevX)
- **VSCode Extension**: A dedicated sidebar extension (`vscode-boring`) to control the agent, view status, and launch the dashboard.
- **Interactive Tutorial 2.0**: A gamified CLI tutorial (`boring tutorial`) to onboard new users with missions and badges.
- **Visual Dashboard**: Real-time WebSocket-powered dashboard for monitoring agent thoughts and detailed logs.

### 🔌 Offline-First Mode
- **Zero-Network Dependency**: Core functionalities (RAG, Logic, Editing) now work 100% offline.
- **Local LLM Support**: Native integration with `local_llm` via `llama-cpp-python`.
- **GGUF Model Manager**: CLI to download and manage quantized models (Llama 3, Qwen 2.5).

## 🚀 CLI Improvements

- **New Commands**:
    - `boring flow`: Start the One Dragon autonomous flow.
    - `boring tutorial`: Launch the interactive gamified tutorial.
    - `boring wizard`: Now supports 15+ clients (Cursor, Claude, VSCode, Trae, etc.).
    - `boring doctor`: Comprehensive system health check.
    - `boring bisect`: AI-driven autonomous bug hunting.
- **Enhanced `boring start`**: Supports `profile` and `flow` arguments.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure

- **Flow Stage Metadata**: Tools are now semantically tagged with stages (`Design`, `Implement`, `Polish`) for smarter routing.
- **Unified State Directory**: Consolidated all config/state into `.boring/` directory.
- **FastMCP Async**: Optimized asynchronous tool registration.

---

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Legacy Removal**: Old directories (`.boring_memory`, `.agent`) are deprecated. Use `boring clean` to remove.
- **Config**: Main config moved to `.boring.toml`.
- **Tool Names**: Some tools renamed for consistency (e.g., `boring_skills_browse` -> `boring_skills_list`).
