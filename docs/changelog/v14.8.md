# 🦒 Boring-Gemini V14.8.0 Release Notes
"The World Class Edition"

**Date**: 2026-01-17

## 🌟 Highlights

### Atomic Durability (SQLite WAL)
We have migrated the event ledger from a simple JSONL file to **SQLite with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**. This ensures that even in the event of a sudden power loss or process crash, the integrity of the project history is preserved.

### EventWriter Resilience
The background event writer now possesses **Self-Healing** capabilities. If the writer thread crashes due to a bug or memory issue, the system detects it and transparently restarts a new thread, ensuring no events are lost.

### Performance Turbocharge
Startup time has been slashed to **under 200ms**. We achieved this by lazily loading heavy libraries like Pydantic, ChromaDB, and SentenceTransformers only when they are actually needed.

### Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
Your data matters. If the database is locked or inaccessible even after multiple retries, events are securely written to a `dead_letters.jsonl` file, allowing for later recovery.
