# V13.0.0 - 2026-01-15 - Multi-Agent & Performance (Async Evolution) ⚡🤖

### 🚀 Major Features
- **Async Agent Evolution (Phase 8)**:
    - **Parallel Orchestration**: Introduced `AsyncAgentRunner` for simultaneous execution of Architect, Coder, and Reviewer.
    - **Performance Scoring**: `AgentScorer` now evaluates agent quality in real-time to optimize routing.
    - **OpenAI Compatible Protocol**: Standardized `boring.agents.protocol` for seamless integration with external providers.
- **Incremental Performance Tuning (Phase 1)**:
    - **Prompt Cache**: Smart context reuse in `ThinkingState` reduces token costs by ~15-30% for iterative loops.
    - **Incremental RAG**: Git-aware indexing only processes modified files, significantly reducing RAG startup time.
    - **Import Lazy-Loading**: Overhauled `boring.intelligence` and `boring.mcp` imports for <500ms startup latency.
- **Semantic Storage Fallback (V13 Core)**:
    - **FAISS Integration**: Full fallback support for semantic search using local FAISS and `sentence-transformers` when ChromaDB is unavailable.
    - **Batch Indexing**: Optimized `BrainManager` to perform batch upserts for patterns, significantly speeding up index rebuilds.
    - **Pure Semantic Search API**: New `get_relevant_patterns_embedding` method for direct semantic retrieval without keyword fallback.
- **Enhanced Observability (Phase 5)**:
    - **Token Tracker**: Real-time dollar-cost and token tracking integrated into `boring_usage_stats`.
    - **Timeline View**: Dashboard now supports event-driven timeline visualization of the entire development loop.
    - **Structured Logging**: Switched to JSON-based structured logs for enterprise-grade auditability.

### 🧩 MCP Tools & Support
- **Multi-Agent CLI (boring_multi_agent)**: Fully upgraded to async execution mode.
- **Cross-Language Support**: Added high-precision AST parsing for Rust, Java, Kotlin, and Scala.
- **Enterprise Git**: Native support for GitLab and Gitee repositories.
- **Batch Processing**: New `boring_batch` tool for sequential automation of independent tasks.

### 🔧 Fixes & Stabilization
- **Test Integrity**: Achieved 1479+ passing tests. Fixed major regression blockers in `ThinkingState` context and async mocking.
- **CLI Modernization**: Deprecated `memory-clear` in favor of unified `clean --all` command.
- **RAG Robustness**: Fixed stale file deletion logic in `RAGRetriever` for accurate vector searches.
- **Path Handling**: Enhanced absolute path support for Windows environments in all Vibe Coder tools.
