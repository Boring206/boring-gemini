# Boring-Gemini V15.1.0 (Smart Wizard & Ecosystem)

## Release Date: 2026-01-18

### 🌍 Ecosystem (Zero-Cost Platform) [NEW]
**Goal**: Decentralized, Serverless, Free.

- **Decentralized Plugins**: New `boring install <git-url>` allows installing extensions directly from GitHub or local `.boring-pack` files.
- **Cognitive Packs**: Defined `.boring-pack` format to bundle Tools, Workflows, Prompts, and Knowledge into a single portable zip.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Added `boring brain export` & `import` to transfer Agent learning (ChromaDB) between teammates.
- **Serverless Collaboration**: New `boring sync` command orchestrates GitOps flows to synchronize SQLite project state without a server.
- **Release Automation**: `boring publish` simplifies the versioning and tagging process for pack creators.

### 🚀 UX Hardening & Resilience (The "Anti-Rage" Update)
**Goal**: Elevate UX from "Frustrating" to "Delightful" (Anti-Keyboard-Smash Index: 5/5).

#### ✨ Quick Wins (UX)
- **Visual Progress**: Added a rich spinner to `flow run` with step counting (e.g., `Step 5/50: Architect`).
- **Cost Awareness**: Added API cost warnings when execution exceeds threshold (25 steps / ~$5).
- **Explicit Feedback**: Architect & Builder now output absolute paths for generated files (`implementation_plan.md`, `task.md`) to avoid "Where is it?" confusion.
- **Task Tracking**: Builder displays granular task progress (e.g., `任務進度: 3/10`).

#### 🧠 Intelligence
- **Goal Validator**: New `GoalValidator` prevents "hallucinated plans" by verifying request feasibility against project structure (e.g., warning if asking for Vue.js in a pure Python project).
- **Smart Stop**: Added `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` check to prevent infinite failure loops.

#### 🛡️ Resilience
- **Interruption Checkpoints**: Added interactive checkpoints every 10 steps to allow users to pause or stop long-running flows safely.
- **Robust File Locking**: Enhanced `TransactionalFileWriter` with adaptive retries (increased delay) to handle Windows file locking (AV/Editor conflicts).
- **Friendly Errors**: Expanded `ErrorTranslator` to cover `WinError 32`, `UnicodeDecodeError`, `JSONDecodeError`, and `RecursionError` with actionable advice.

#### 🔧 Technical
- **Auto Mode Support**: Propagated `auto_mode` flag to `FlowContext` to enable headless testing and automation.

#### 🌊 Advanced (Phase 4)
- **Streaming Support**: Implemented `GeminiProvider.generate_stream` and `ArchitectNode` UI feedback ("Thinking...") to reduce user anxiety during long generation tasks.
- **State Serialization**: Added `StateSerializer` to save flow state (`.boring/checkpoints/latest.json`). Triggered automatically on interruption, enabling future `resume` capabilities.
