# Speckit Constitution Workflow

Use this workflow to establish your project's governing principles.

## Steps

1. Create or update `openspec/constitution.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
# Project Constitution

## Mission
[One-line description of what this project aims to achieve]

## Core Principles
1. [Principle 1]
2. [Principle 2]
3. [Principle 3]

## Quality Standards
- Code must have type hints
- All public functions require docstrings
- Tests must pass before merging

## Development Guidelines
- Think before coding (plan in artifacts/)
- Act with clean, modular code
- Reflect by running tests and verifying
```

2. Review and adjust principles based on project needs
