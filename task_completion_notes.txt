The `_get_vscode_settings_path` function in `src/boring/cli/wizard.py` has been modified to return the path if its parent directory exists, making the VS Code configuration detection more proactive.

Old code:
```python
        return path if path.exists() else None
```

New code:
```python
        return path if path.parent.exists() else None
```

This change allows the wizard to suggest configuring VS Code settings even if the `settings.json` file itself doesn't exist yet, as long as the parent `User` directory does.
