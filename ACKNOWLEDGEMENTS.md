# Acknowledgements & Credits

Boring-Gemini stands on the shoulders of giants. We gratefully acknowledge the following individuals, organizations, and research that inspired this project.

## Concepts & Methodologies

*   **Vibe Coding**: Detailed by **Andrej Karpathy** (February 2025), "Vibe Coding" describes the shift from writing syntax to guiding AI behavior through natural language and intent. This project is a practical implementation of that philosophy.
*   **Shadow Mode**: Use of "Shadow Mode" for safe AI operations is standard in deployment engineering (e.g., Tesla Autopilot, Canary Deployments). Our implementation adapts this for agentic coding safety.
*   **LLM-as-a-Judge**: The evaluation framework in `boring.judge` is inspired by research into using LLMs to evaluate other models.

## Technologies & Standards

*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: This project implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), an open standard developed by **Anthropic**.
*   **Google Gemini**: This project is built to control the [Gemini CLI](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/), a product of **Google DeepMind**.
