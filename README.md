## ⚡ Beyond Generative AI: Agentic Cognition

Boring-Gemini isn't just a collection of tools; it's the **thinking layer** for your AI development workflow. While standard AI models *suggest* code, Boring **reasons, verifies, and learns**.

### 🧞‍♂️ The Vibe Coder Philosophy
> **"Intent is the new Implementation."**
>
> In the era of Vibe Coding, your role shifts from writing syntax to defining **Intent**. Boring-Gemini acts as your agentic partner, handling the gap between a "Vibe" (Natural Language) and "Production" (Verified Code).

---

## 🚀 The Three Pillars of Autonomy

### 🧠 Pillar I: [Cognitive Reasoning (Agentic Loop)](docs/features/agents.md)
Boring implements a rigorous **Planning -> Execution -> Verification** loop. It doesn't just run commands; it uses `sequentialthinking` and `criticalthinking` to analyze its own steps, critiquing logic *before* hitting your disk.

### 🛡️ Pillar II: [Resilient Autonomy (Active Recall)](docs/features/global-brain.md)
The first agent with a **Global Brain**. When Boring encounters a failure, it consults its persistent knowledge base (`.boring/brain`) to recall how similar issues were solved across sessions. It learns from its mistakes so you don't have to.

### ⚡ Pillar III: [Ultra-Fast Ecosystem (UV Native)](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
Designed for the modern Python stack. Boring natively supports **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** for near-instant package management, lockfile synchronization, and isolated environment execution.

### ⚓ Pillar IV: [Production-Grade Safety (Safety Net)](docs/features/shadow-mode.md)
Trust is built on safety. Boring automatically creates **Git Checkpoints** before any risky operation. Combined with **Shadow Mode**, you have a "undo" button for AI agentic actions, ensuring your repository remains stable even during complex refactors.

### 🧬 Pillar V: [Cognitive Evolution (V11.2.2)](docs/features/cognitive.md)
Not just execution, but evolution. V11.2 introduces **Adaptive Reasoning & Visualization**.
- **Critical Thinking**: Built-in multi-layered reasoning states ensuring the Agent performs deep analysis before executing complex logic.
- **Active Causal Memory**: Automatically learns from errors, building a "intuition" library.
- **Lightweight Mode (BORING_LAZY_MODE)**:
  - **Benefits**: Zero-friction, zero-pollution. Usage in new directories caches state in a global directory instead of creating a local `.boring` folder. Perfect for "Quick Fixes" or "Temporary Scans".
- **Live Tool Synthesis**: The Agent can write and compile its own Python tools on the fly.
- **Interactive Brain Map**: Visualize your project's knowledge clusters with a physics-based network graph (Vis.js).

## 🛠️ Key Capabilities

| | Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🧠 | **[Cognitive Router](docs/features/mcp-tools.md)** | No need to learn 100+ tool names. Say *"Check impact of modifying utils.py"* or *"Review my code"* — Boring handles the routing. |
| 🕵️ | **[Hybrid RAG](docs/features/rag.md)** | Combined Vector + Dependency Graph search. Understands not just *what* code says, but *how* it's used globally. |
| 🧪 | **[Vibe Check](docs/features/quality-gates.md)** | Gamified health scanning. Calculates a **Vibe Score** and generates a "One-Click Fix Prompt" for the agent. |
| 🛡️ | **[Active Recall](docs/features/global-brain.md)** | Automatically learns from error patterns. Recalls past solutions to avoid repeating mistakes across sessions. |
| 📚 | **[Full Tool Reference](docs/reference/APPENDIX_A_TOOL_REFERENCE.md)** | Complete catalog of 98+ tools with parameters and usage ([中文](docs/reference/APPENDIX_A_TOOL_REFERENCE_zh.md)). |
| 🧬 | **[Skill Compilation](docs/features/cognitive.md)** | Distills repeated successfulpatterns into high-level **Strategic Skills**. |

## 🛠️ Usage & Workflows

### 💎 Top Interaction Triggers
Just say these phrases to the AI in your IDE (Cursor/Claude):

- **`start session`**: 🚀 **Ultimate Integration**. Activates Deep Thinking to autonomously manage the entire lifecycle of a complex task.
- **`/vibe_start`**: Kick off a new project from scratch.
- **`quick_fix`**: Automatically repair all linting and formatting errors.
- **`review_code`**: Request a technical audit of your current file.
- **`smart_commit`**: Generate a semantic commit message from your progress.
- **`boring_vibe_check`**: Run a comprehensive health scan of the project.

---

## 🧠 External Intelligence
Boring comes bundled with elite tools to boost AI performance:
- **Context7**: Real-time documentation querying for the latest libraries.
- **Thinking Mode**: Forces the agent into deep analytical reasoning (Sequential Thinking).
- **Security Shadow Mode**: A safety sandbox that intercepts dangerous AI operations.
