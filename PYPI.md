## 🚀 Quick Installation

### Smithery (Recommended)

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install boring/boring --client cursor
```

### Local pip

```bash
pip install boring-aicoding[mcp]
```

---

## 📦 Usage

### As MCP Server (Recommended)

Add to your IDE's MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "boring": {
      "command": "boring-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### CLI Tools (Run in Terminal/CMD)

> **Note**: These are standalone CLI commands. Run them in your terminal, not in MCP client.

```bash
boring-monitor           # TUI Dashboard (Terminal UI)
boring-dashboard         # Web Dashboard (Opens browser)
boring-route "query"     # Shows which tool would be used (demo only, doesn't execute)
python -m boring status  # Health check
python -m boring verify  # Code verification
```

**About `boring-route`**: This command only **shows** which MCP tool would be selected for your query. To actually execute the tool, use it in your MCP client (Cursor/Claude Desktop).
